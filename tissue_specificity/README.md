Tissue-specificity analysis
------

Evaluating the tissue specificity of host targets found in the current study, the Tissue Atlas dataset was obtained from the Human Protein Atlas database (version: 2021.04.09).
We combined the "tissue enriched", "group enriched" and "tissue enhanced" as the "tissue-specificity" category, and denoted the "low tissue specificity" as the "common" category.
