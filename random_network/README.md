Enrichment of previously known, phospho-regulated or RNA-binding host targets
------

- The IntAct database was used to collect human proteins, based on the binary interactions between virus and human proteins.
- The human proteins with phosphorylation changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in A549 and Vero E6 cell lines were used to evaluate the host targets' phosphorylation status in the current study.
- Human proteins either specifically bound to SARS-CoV-2 RNA or with altered RNA-binding activity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection were gathered from a recent RNA-interactome capture screen.

These data were used to evaluate the enrichment of SARS-CoV-2 targeted host proteins in the current study.
