# A proteome-scale map of the SARS-CoV-2-human Contactome

This repository contains the code for the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2-human contactome.

Most of the code is in R, with some Python and bash scripts.

The scripts were used for the analyses of 
- estimating sampling sensitivity of the GFP and yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) assay.
- biological relevant of the SARS-CoV-2 contactome
- shared host protein domains
- network communities
- COVID19 comorbidities
